1 Find N, where N=p*q, p, q are prime

2 Find private key e, where e and (p-1)(q-1) is relative, (because thus, e have multive inverse d, )
  gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1))   // here, we use Euclid method.
  
3 Find public key, d, e*d mod (p-1)(q-1) =1 // here, we use ExtEuclid method.

4 public key (N, e)
5 Encrypt:  y= m^e mod N 
6 Decrypt:  m= y^d mod N //because d is huge, so we use FastExpMod here.
