NP problem: problems can be verified in polynomial time.
P problem:  problems can be solved in polynomial time.

p belong to NP !             NP belong to P ???

NPC: (NP completed problems)
    1 It's a NP problem.  2 All NP problems can reduction to this problem.
    First NPC problem: SAT
    Since all NP can change to NPC, so if one NPC has polynomial time solution, then all NP has polynomial solutions.

NP-Hard: 
    1 It's NOT a NP problem(Means can not verified in polynomial time ??).  2 All NP problems can reduction to this problem.
