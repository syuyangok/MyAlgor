NP problem: ALl search problems (1 Form: Given an instance; output soluion or None.  2 problems can be verified in polynomial time).
P problem:  Search problems can be solved in polynomial time.

p belong to NP !             NP belong to P ???

NPC: (NP completed problems)
    1 It's a NP problem.  2 All NP problems can reduction to this problem.
    First NPC problem: SAT
    
    Since all NP can change to NPC, so if one NPC has polynomial time solution, then all NP has polynomial solutions.
    So if P!= NP, all NPC are not in P. (Becuase if any NPC in P, all the NP will in P, which is contradict our asumption)

NP-Hard: 
    1 It's Maybe/NOT a NP problem(Means can not verified in polynomial time ??)????.  2 All NP problems can reduction to this problem.
