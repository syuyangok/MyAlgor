SAT to 3SAT

input: SAT with k variable

Consider f for SAT
Create f` for use in 3SAT
  for each clause in SAT:
      if |C| <= 3, add C to f`;
      if |C| > 3:
          create k-3 new variable
          create new clause C` and add to f`
          
 f is satisfiable == f` is satisfiable
 
 
 How to Create C`:
    create k-3 new variable;
    create k-2 new clauses to replace old C, as follow:
          C`= (a1 v a2 v y1) ^ (y1- v a3 v y2) ^ (y2- v a4 v y3) ..... ^ (yk-3 - v ak-1 v ak) 
          
  C is satisfiable == C` is satisfiable
