If we found feasible x & feasible y, where cTx = bTy, then:
  x & y are optimal.

if Primal LP is unbounded, then Dual LP is infeasible.

if Dual LP is unbounded, then prime LP is infeasible.

    if Dual LP is infeasible, then prime LP is infeasible/unbounded.

How to check if Primal LP is unbounded ?

  first, we check if Primal LP is feasible:
      Add a new z, to make Ax +z <= b; if z is non-negative, LP is feasible; Otherwise, LP is infeasible;
  
  Then, we check if Dual LP is feasible:
      if Dual LP is infeasible, and prime LP feasible, then prime LP is unbounded
