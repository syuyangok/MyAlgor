Optimum of LP is achived a vetex of feasible region, except:
a) Infeasible = feasible region is empty:
     Only dependents on constrain functions( constrain functions are infeasible). Noting to do with Object function.
     
b) unbounded = optimum is arbitarily large.
       Only dependents on objective function
