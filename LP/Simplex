If we have n variables, and m constrains funcitons:
     then we have n dimensions.
     then we have total n+m constrains.(Because, for each variable musht >=0)
     Feasible = intersection of n+m halfspace in n dimensions.
     
     Vertices = points satisfying:  
          n constrains with =
          m constrains with <=
     We have Vertices <= choose n from (n+m). Neighbors <= nm 
     


Optimum of LP is achived a vetex of feasible region, except:
a) Infeasible = feasible region is empty:
     Only dependents on constrain functions( constrain functions are infeasible). Noting to do with Object function.
     
b) unbounded = optimum is arbitarily large.
       Only dependents on objective function ???
