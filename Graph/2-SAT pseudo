//Lemma:
For some i, if xi & xi- are in same SCC, then not satisify
For all i, if xi & xi- are in differenct SCC, then  satisify

//Key facts: if for all i, xi & xi- are in different SCC, then S is a sink SCC, S- is a source SCC.

// 2SAT(formula f):
    1 Construct graph G for f.
    2 Run SCC, get sink S.
    3 Take a sink S:
          set S = true  (S- = false)
          remove S and S-
          repeat untile empty.
