// Tree:  Every vertex is connected; Iff have n-1 edges

input: undirected G, with weight edge w(e)
Kruskal's(G):
    1 Sort edge with w increase
    2 Create empty tree, X
    3 Loop edges(v, w) in order:
          if Xu e doesn't have a cycle, then: X= Xu e
    4 return X
    
    
    // check if Xu e doesn't have a cycle: before add, if componets(v) = componets(w), then it is a cycle.
    
    
Run time:
Dominated by sort = O(|E|log|V|)
