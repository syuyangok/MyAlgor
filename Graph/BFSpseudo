Bread First search

Input G, v;
Output: For all vertices u reachable from s, dist(u) is set to the distance from s to u.

label v as visited;
Greate a Q;
Q.enqueue(v);

While Q is not empty:
  Q.dequeue();
  for w (every neighbor of v):
    if w is not visited:
      lab w as visited;
      Q.enqueue(w);
 
// run time O(|V| + |E|)
// Use this for unweighted Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
// for weighted we need use Dijkstra
