//Strongly connected compentes




SCC(G):
    1 Construct GR
    2 Run DFS on GR, //to get postorder number, max post# is source vertex, which is sink vertex in G.
    3 Order vertex by post# decrease, // first vertex source vertex
    4 Run DFS again(undirected connected components) on G, on Ordered above vertex, 
    
 Run time:  Two DFS, O(n+M)
