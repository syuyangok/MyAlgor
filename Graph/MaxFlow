Ford-Fulkseron:
1 Let fe = 0,  for all e
2  Create Residual network Gf for G.


3 Find path S-t path in Gf,
    if no such path, return current flow
    
4 if have path: Given p, let c(p) = min capcity alone p in Gf,
                Augment f by c(p) units, alone p
5 repeat 2-5 step,  untile no such path. 


// run time: O(Cm)    C is size of max flow.
//  m is run time of DFS/BFS in step 3, bounded by O(|E|), because m = n-1
